# RHeddit

A example social media website. The hosted site can be viewed working [here](http://chemical-friends.surge.sh/)

To run the site locally on your machine, clone the repo and than run `npm start`.

The site has been built using `React`, `Axios @reach/router` and `Style-Components` on the front end, and `Express.js`, `Knex`, and `Postgres` on the back end.

The Back end site is hosted [here](https://rh-nc-news.herokuapp.com/api) and the GitHub repo can be viewed [here](https://github.com/richhouse83/be-nc-news). All production code has been written by myself, with help from the fabulous staff at [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
